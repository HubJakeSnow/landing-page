# landing-page
What did I learn from making this landing page?
- To make my code clear. e.g Using /* */ in CSS to name code or to make comments.
- Make an extra container when I cannot get things into the place I would like them to go to.
--> Including an extra left and right when needed. This could be in addition to the extra container mentioned above.
- Try to use "em" instead of "px" for things like padding when I can as they scale better?
